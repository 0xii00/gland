# Examples Directory

Welcome to the `examples/` directory of the framework! This directory contains a variety of example applications that demonstrate the features and capabilities of the framework in different scenarios. Each subdirectory represents a standalone application, complete with its own configuration, controllers, services, middleware, and any other required components.

## Usage

Each example is self-contained and can be run independently. To get started:

1. Navigate to the desired example directory (e.g., `cd examples/basic-app`).
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. (Optional) Run tests for the application:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system before running the examples.
